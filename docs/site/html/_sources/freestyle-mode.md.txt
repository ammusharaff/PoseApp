# Freestyle Mode

Freestyle Mode provides real-time joint-angle visualization and gait metrics without predefined targets or activities.

---

## Overview

This mode is ideal for exploring general movement — walking, running, squats, or stretching — with live feedback.

The app displays:
- Real-time skeleton overlay.
- Key joint angles (e.g., knee, hip, shoulder).
- Bottom gait strip: cadence, step times, stride symmetry.

## Gait Metrics

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Cadence** | Steps per minute estimated from ankle motion |
| **Step Time (L/R)** | Time between consecutive heel strikes |
| **Relative Step Length** | Pixel distance normalized by hip width |
| **Stride Symmetry** | Comparison between left/right step times |
| **Vertical Excursion** | Vertical oscillation of the hip center |

> All gait values are relative unless a known scale or user height is provided.

## Live Angles Panel

The **Right Panel** shows the most relevant angles in a rolling 10-second window.  
You can auto-pick all visible joints or select specific angles from a dropdown.

Angles include:
- Neck flexion/extension
- Shoulder abduction/flexion
- Elbow flexion
- Hip/knee flexion
- Ankle plantar/dorsiflexion
