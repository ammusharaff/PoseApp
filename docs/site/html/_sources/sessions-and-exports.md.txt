Here’s the **final, full version** of your `sessions-and-exports.md`, rewritten professionally based on the *official project brief*, your current implementation (from our chats), and the PoseApp architecture.

## 📊 `sessions-and-exports.md`

```markdown
# Sessions and Exports

PoseApp automatically logs and exports every training or evaluation session.  
A *session* includes all freestyle and guided activities performed until the user ends it manually or closes the app.  
Each session is fully offline and stored locally for analysis and reproducibility.

---

## 🧩 Session Lifecycle

1. **Start Session**  
   - Triggered automatically when the app begins recording.  
   - A new timestamped directory is created under `/sessions/<ISO8601_TIMESTAMP>/`.

2. **During Session**  
   - Each activity (guided or freestyle) appends its raw keypoints, computed angles, gait metrics, and scores to the active session.  
   - Guided activities also log per-rep scores and symmetry indices.

3. **Stop Session / Exit App**  
   - When you click **Stop Session** or close the app, the final session summary is written to disk.  
   - This ensures **one unified session report** across multiple activities.

## 📂 Export Directory Structure

Each session directory is timestamped and follows a standardized layout:

```

/sessions/2025-10-22T20-35-11Z/
├─ raw_keypoints.json       # Per-frame keypoints and visibility
├─ angles.csv               # Time, joint name, side, angle (deg)
├─ gait.csv                 # Step metrics and cadence
├─ summary.json             # Combined per-session summary
└─ scorecards/              # Optional per-activity sub-reports

## 📜 Export File Details

### 🧠 raw_keypoints.json
Contains every detected keypoint with coordinates and visibility per frame.

```json
{
  "frame_id": 45,
  "timestamp": 1739.58,
  "backend": "MoveNet-Thunder",
  "keypoints": {
    "left_knee": [0.421, 0.743, 0.98],
    "right_knee": [0.576, 0.745, 0.99],
    "left_ankle": [0.422, 0.812, 0.97]
  }
}
````

### 📐 angles.csv

Stores all computed joint angles for each frame.

| Column       | Description                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `timestamp`  | Time in seconds since session start  |
| `joint_name` | e.g. `knee_L`, `hip_R`, `shoulder_L` |
| `side`       | Left or Right                        |
| `angle_deg`  | Smoothed joint angle (degrees)       |

Example:

```
timestamp,joint_name,side,angle_deg
1739.38,knee_L,Left,92.6
1740.02,knee_L,Left,95.3
```

### 🏃 gait.csv

Stores gait metrics recorded during freestyle motion.

| Column                             | Description                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `cadence`                          | Steps per minute                    |
| `step_time_L`, `step_time_R`       | Time between heel strikes           |
| `rel_step_len_L`, `rel_step_len_R` | Step length normalized by hip width |
| `SI`                               | Symmetry Index                      |
| `timestamp`                        | Reference frame timestamp           |

Example:

```
cadence,step_time_L,step_time_R,rel_step_len_L,rel_step_len_R,SI,timestamp
112.5,0.56,0.58,1.12,1.08,3.6,1745.2
```

### 🧾 summary.json

The unified session report. It aggregates all activities (guided and freestyle) under one structure.

**Structure:**

```json
{
  "session_id": "sess-20251022-203511",
  "device_id": "glass-01",
  "os": "Ubuntu 24.04",
  "cpu": "Ryzen 5 5600U",
  "start_time": "2025-10-22T20:35:11Z",
  "end_time": "2025-10-22T20:55:30Z",
  "activities": [
    {
      "name": "Squat",
      "reps_completed": 5,
      "mean_accuracy": 0.93,
      "form_stability": 0.88,
      "symmetry_index": 4.6
    },
    {
      "name": "Arm Abduction",
      "reps_completed": 5,
      "mean_accuracy": 0.90,
      "symmetry_index": 6.2
    }
  ],
  "overall_session_score": 0.91,
  "export_files": [
    "angles.csv",
    "gait.csv",
    "summary.json"
  ]
}
```

## 🧮 Session Summary Dialog (UI)

* Accessible from the **toolbar → Session Summary** or automatically after pressing **Stop Session**.
* Displays:

  * Total session duration and FPS
  * Activity list with scores
  * Mean form stability and symmetry index
  * Export buttons for CSV/JSON
* The summary **remains active for the full session**, allowing multiple guided activities to be aggregated.

## ⚙️ Export Behavior

| Action            | Effect                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Auto Export**   | CSV/JSON written continuously during runtime     |
| **Manual Export** | Trigger from toolbar anytime                     |
| **Stop Session**  | Finalizes and writes `summary.json`              |
| **Exit App**      | Gracefully closes threads, saves pending buffers |

All timestamps use **monotonic time**, ensuring replay consistency across reruns.

---

## 🧾 Determinism & Validation

Each session is **reproducible** — reprocessing the same input yields identical CSV/JSON exports.
This is verified by the deterministic timestamp generator and consistent angle math across backends.

**Testing checkpoints:**

* Session runs offline (no network access)
* FPS ≥ 20 at 720p on i5/Ryzen5
* CSV/JSON schemas validated by test suite
* Exports identical for identical input video

---

## 🧠 Developer Notes

* Exports are flushed incrementally via the `SessionLogger` class.
* JSON and CSV writers handle file locking to avoid data loss on crashes.
* The session summary persists across all guided activities in a single runtime.
* Session folders are human-readable and timestamped for easy archival.

## 🧱 Example Workflow

1. Start PoseApp → Select model → Guided mode → *Squat*
2. Perform 5 reps → score appended
3. Switch to *Arm Abduction* → perform 5 reps → score appended
4. Open Session Summary → see both activities listed
5. Click **Export → summary.json + CSV**
6. Exit → session folder finalized under `/sessions/<timestamp>/`
