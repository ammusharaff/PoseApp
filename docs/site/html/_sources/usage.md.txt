## Backends

### MoveNet (TFLite)
- High-speed, full-body inference.
- Two variants: **Lightning** (fast, lightweight) and **Thunder** (higher accuracy).
- Ideal for **freestyle** mode.

### MediaPipe (Holistic/Hands)
- Multi-pose and hand-gesture support.
- Best for **guided** tasks or detailed limb tracking.

Model switching occurs instantly at runtime and is preserved across sessions.
