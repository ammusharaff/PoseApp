PoseApp Documentation
=====================

PoseApp is a cross-platform offline desktop application built for human pose estimation, joint-angle analytics, and guided movement scoring.  
It supports both **freestyle** and **guided** modes, live gait metrics, and exports to CSV/JSON for offline review.  
The system runs entirely offline, using **MediaPipe** or **MoveNet (Lightning/Thunder)** models selectable at runtime.
