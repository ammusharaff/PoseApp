# Getting Started

PoseApp is a **cross-platform offline desktop app** for human pose estimation, gait analysis, and guided exercise scoring.  
It runs entirely offline, with all models bundled, and supports Linux (AppImage), Windows (.exe), and macOS (.dmg optional).

## Installation

### 1. System Requirements
- **OS:** Fedora, Ubuntu 22.04+, Windows 10+, macOS (optional)
- **CPU:** Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 or better
- **Python (for source run):** 3.10–3.12  
- **RAM:** ≥ 8 GB  
- **Camera:** Any standard UVC webcam

### 2. Setup from Source

Clone the repository and create a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone <your-private-repo-url> PoseApp
cd PoseApp
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # (Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Run the app:

python -m app.main

# UI Tour

Toolbar: Camera • Start/Stop • Mode (Freestyle/Guided) • Settings • Export • Live Angles (reopen right dock).

Left Dock (Guided): Activity selector, GIF preview, targets, Start Trial.

Right Dock (Live Angles): Rolling 10-second plots; auto-pick or manual dropdown to choose angles.

Overlays: Skeleton, joint-angle labels, gait strip (cadence, step times, symmetry).

Shortcuts: S Start/Stop • G Mode toggle • M Model toggle • E Export • 1..5 Quick activity select.


# Modes

## Freestyle

    Draws skeleton and angle readouts.

    Gait tracker estimates cadence, step timing, relative step length, and symmetry.

## Guided

    Choose an activity (e.g., Squat, Arm Abduction).

    App shows a GIF, counts down, segments reps automatically, scores accuracy, and reports symmetry.

    Multiple guided activities can be performed in one session; the session summary aggregates them.
